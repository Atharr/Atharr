	- science (especially Astronomy, Computer Science, Physics & Math);
	- technology (mainly computers, electronics & space exploration);
	- music (especially rock, blues, classical music & opera);
	- reading (literature, fiction, science fiction, comics... it goes on!);
	- politics (libertarianism);
	- and much more (movies, gaming, cooking _et cetera_...); ok, I'll stop here.
